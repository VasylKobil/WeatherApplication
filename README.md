# WeatherApplication
My second project helps users to find out the weather forecast wherever they are. Additionally this app can provide you with information about your localization. More over,the Google function of autocomplete is used in order to help users to input geographic place faster. This project was supported by HTML, CSS, JavaScript cods. The main task of this project is connecting API REST address with another website.
